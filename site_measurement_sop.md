# Site Measurement Standard Operating Procedure

## What is Site Measurement?

The purpose of site measurements at Sitrling Woodworks is to ensure that all products fit exactly within the physical constraints of the clients space.

We create highly customized products and those products are often in variable locations with many physical constraints that lead to the final design. It is incredibly important that our site measurements are carried out thoroughly with laser percision (literally).

The reason that we carry out these exhaustive site measurements is to ensure that when the installation teams attempts to install the product there are no issues fitting the product into the space.

Things Like:

* Does the product fit through the front door?
* Do all of the pieces fit inside the elevator?
* Will the flooring or wall covering thickness interfere with any of the reveals of the product.

## What tools are needed to carry out a sucessful site measurement?

1. The most recent version of Stirling Woodworks drawings
2. Tape Measure
3. Laser Measuring Device

   * This can either be your own personal laser measuring device or Stirling owns a Leica Laser that can be taken to site.

4. Lazer Level
5. Pen or Pencil

    * If you plan on creating digital markups pease see the [Digital Markup](docs.stirlingwoodworks.com/digital_markups) documentation.

## Who should carry out the Site Measurement?

All site measurement should be carried out by the person creating the drawings. This means that the engineer creating the drawings will have to schedule a time to go through the site with either the site supervisor or the client. If you have questions or concerns regarding contacting external contact please see the [External Contact Documentation](docs.stirlingwoodworks.com/external_contact).

## Dependancies

So we know why we need to site measure, we have all of the necessary tools but how do we make sure that we have all of the information that wee need.

Often when we initially make a site visit there are a few questions that we need to know in order to have all of the information we need to carry out our site measurement.

Here is an example of a few of those questions:

* What is the wall covering in this room?
* What is the flooring thickness in this room, and is there a specific height that the floor is being leveled too?
* What is the casing thickness?

There as so many variables that it would be impossible to cover them all here so use your judgement and try to ask as many questions as possible

## Step by Step Guide on How to Measure a Room

Here we will go through an example Room and measure it.

Here is our room:

![Finished Wedgewood Women's Washroom](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e64ace_20136f9931ad46bfa921e4e1ca7f03d5~mv2.jpg)

**REMEMBER**
There are three measurements that are crtical for any location:

* Height
* Width
* Depth

After that you will always require some reference to another measured point. For instance:

Lets assume that you have measured the overall width of a wall. Now you are planning on measuring for the electrical outlet locations. Start from one side of the room and work your way across, referencing each box as you go along. 

<!-- Add Before, After and Measured

These should be hosted on WIX -->

## Site Changes

<!-- What if I notice a change that needs to be made to an existing fixture or wall while I am on site?
Add Documentation about contacting General contractors about making changes to site things-->

## Terminology

### AFF - "As finished Floor"
> This is the height of something in relation to the finalized finished floor height.
